# Semantic Search with SBERT

This repository contains a semantic search tool using a Sentence-BERT (SBERT) model to find books based on similarity scores. The tool loads book data and allows searching for relevant titles using pre-trained or fine-tuned SBERT models with FAISS for efficient similarity search.
